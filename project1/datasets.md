# Project 1 Dataset Exploration

## Potential Datasets

### 1. Heart Disease Dataset (via UCI Machine Learning Repo)
* **Link:** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
* **Initial Thoughts:** This is a smaller and cleaner dataset that would be great for practicing classification models.
* **Questions:**
    * Which clinical factors have the highest correlation with heart disease diagnosis?
    * Is there a significant difference in the predictive accuracy of the model when comparing different geographic origins of the data (e.g., Cleveland vs. Switzerland)?

### 2. Emotion Dataset (via Hugging Face Datasets)
* **Link:** [https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion)
* **Initial Thoughts:** A dataset of English Twitter messages with six emotions. This would make it easy to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) within our GCP environment.
* **Questions:**
    * What are the most common word associations for the "joy" vs. "anger" labels?

## Summary
Our group is  exploring these options to see which provides the best balance of data volume and interesting research questions. We hope to come to a conclusion pretty soon about what we would like to do :)
